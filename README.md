# The New York Times' Famous Game "Wordle" in Java.

> ### Description
>
> Wordle is an innovative game that tests your logic skills as well as your vocabulary. First developed by Josh Wardle, then later sold to big media comapany *The New York Times*. I have taken up the task to recreate this famous game in Java and are successful. Though it is not perfect, I have tried to recreate it to the best of my abilities.

> ### Prerequisite
> Just have JRE or JDK 18 installed to run this program.

> ### How to Download and Run
>
> 1. Just go to the *Releases* and download the zip and unzip in a location of your preference.
> 2. Navigate into the project and open the Terminal or CMD in the project folder and execute `java -jar wordle.jar`

> ### A Few Changes
>
> As I am an amateur coder, I made some small compromises (doesn't affect the overall game). First, I display only the number of double letters and not show them in the word itself; this makes the game a little more difficult. To counter it, I added 1 more try so you get a total of 7 tries. Also, when 2 of the same letters in a guess are the same, there could be only be one depending on the display of the multiple letters.
